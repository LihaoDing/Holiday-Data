# Holiday Data Management System

This project provides a robust Java application designed to demonstrate the use of design patterns and effective data management through a series of interconnected modules. It leverages principles of object-oriented programming to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several Java classes, each responsible for a specific part of the application's functionality:

- **Data Classes**: Handle the manipulation and storage of data.
- **Client Classes**: Manage user interactions and input processing.
- **Output Classes**: Responsible for data presentation and output formatting.
- **Facade Pattern**: Implements a facade to provide a simplified interface to more complex subsystems.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Holiday Classes**: Specific classes to manage holiday-related data.
- **Testing Classes**: Facilitates the testing of different components to ensure they function correctly.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and modify, thanks to clear separation of concerns.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizes design patterns like Facade and Singleton to solve common design issues.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure application reliability and correctness.
